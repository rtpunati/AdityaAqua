We are delighted to answer any questions you may have regarding anything from sourcing to sustainability to recipes and the health benefits of seafood. A list of frequently asked questions is provided below.

1.Can I order products online from you to ship to my home?<br></strong>

<strong style="color:black;">2.What does the shrimp "count per pound" mean? How is the size of shrimp calculated?
</strong><br><b>A)</b>Understanding shrimp sizing can be tricky. Chances are, you’ve noticed a number on the front of a bag of shrimp. Is it referring to the size of the shrimp or the number of shrimp in the bag? In most cases, it’s referring to the actual size. Shrimp size is designated by “count per pound,” meaning, if the number reads “26/30 ct/lb,” that’s the number of shrimp per each pound. It does not necessarily mean there are 26-30 shrimp in the package. For example, a 2-pound bag of size 26/30 ct/lb shrimp would have 52-60 shrimp in the bag. The lower the number of shrimp per pound, the larger the shrimp is, and vice versa.

Note, there’s no standard definition for the descriptor of each size designation; it can vary by retailer. This table is a helpful guide to assist you in understanding shrimp sizing and the number of shrimp you can expect to find in any given pack.

<p style="color: black;"><u><strong style="color: black;">SUSTAINABILITY</u><br>
1.What is aquaculture?</strong>
<br>
<b>A)</b>The cultivation of marine and freshwater finfish and shellfish is known as aquaculture. This seafood may have been described as "farm-raised" in the past. Freshwater and marine aquaculture are the two types. While freshwater refers to species that reside in rivers, lakes, and streams, marine aquaculture refers to the cultivation of species that live in the ocean. Many of your favorite seafood species are available all year round because to aquaculture. The need for aquaculture is expanding along with the demand for seafood. In India nowadays, farm-raised seafood makes up nearly half of the seafood eaten.
<br>

<strong style="color: black;">2.What makes seafood sustainable?</strong><br>
<b>A)</b>Sustainable seafood is fish that has been collected in the wild or farmed in a way that preserves the ecosystem and the species' long-term supply, or life cycle, so that it will be available to future generations.<br>

<strong style="color: black;">3.Why is seafood sustainability important?</strong>
<br>
<b>A)</b>As the world's population grows, so does seafood consumption. Many of the world's fisheries are currently overfished. The long-term sustainability of our seafood resources and ecosystem is critical to our overall well-being and health, as well as the well-being and health of future generations. See what we're doing to support sustainable seafood practices on our Seafood ForeverTM page.
<br>
<br><br>
<u><strong style="color: black;">HEALTH & NUTRITION</u><br>
1.What are the health benefits of seafood?</strong><br>
<b>A)</b>Seafood is an integral part of a healthy diet due to its numerous health advantages. Seafood is high in protein and other critical nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids, which can benefit cardiovascular and neurological health. Visit our Seafood Health & Nutrition website for more information on the health advantages of seafood.
<br>
<strong style="color: black;">2.How much seafood should I eat per week?</strong><br>
<b>A)</b>According to the Inia's 2015 - 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Indians, one cup of seafood per week is recommended. Other government agencies advocate eating seafood twice a week to maintain a healthy diet.

<br>
<strong style="color: black;">3.How can I get my family to eat more seafood?</strong><br>
<b>A)</b>We understand how difficult it may be to introduce new foods to your children, especially healthy foods. Instead of asking, "Do you like that?" take a different approach and tell them how much they're going to adore their food. To help them develop their palette, introduce different ingredients and seasonings. Incorporating fresh flavors into an old favorite is a great way to create a new and fascinating dinner. Find great family-friendly meals in our recipe area for mealtime inspiration.
<br>

<strong style="color: black;">4.Can I include seafood in my gluten-free diet?</strong>
<br>
<b>A)</b>Yes! Seafood is gluten-free by nature. Gluten may, however, be added to select items as breading, batter, or other coatings.
<br>

<strong style="color: black;">5.Should I be concerned about mercury in seafood? What about pregnant or nursing women and young children?</strong><br>
<b>A)</b>The 2010 USDA Dietary Guidelines study states that for the vast majority of Americans, the health benefits of eating a variety of seafood exceed the hazards associated with methyl mercury. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that women who may become pregnant, women who are pregnant, women who are nursing, and young children avoid four types of seafood known to be high in mercury: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish. They also advise such people to consume albacore tuna no more than once each week. It's worth noting that the FDA/EPA recommendation emphasizes healthy seafood consumption:

<br><br><br>

<strong style="color: black;">"A well-balanced diet rich in fish and shellfish can benefit heart health and children's proper growth and development." As a result of the numerous nutritional benefits, mothers and young children in particular should incorporate fish or shellfish in their diets."
